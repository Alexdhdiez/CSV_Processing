# CSV_Processing
This practical case represents the first evaluable practical delivery of the course and involves the creation of a collection of tools, based on grep, sed, awk and bash scripts, aimed at processing text files using regular expressions as a basis. The input files will be text files in CSV format containing open data, from which a normalised version must be obtained, some of the information extracted and reports produced.

The main file, and the one that should be executed to run the CSV processor is the bash script called `guion`.
